# Impact of Remote Work on Mental Health

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the impact of remote work on mental health across various industries and demographics. The analysis uses a dataset of 5,000 employees to explore factors like stress levels, productivity, work-life balance, and satisfaction with remote work.

## Data Source
The dataset, "Impact of Remote Work on Mental Health," includes information on demographics, work location, mental health status, productivity, and satisfaction. [If publicly available, include a link to the dataset source.]

## Statistical Techniques and Methods
This project uses a range of statistical and ML techniques:
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Summary statistics and visualizations to understand data distribution.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Testing differences across groups using t-tests or ANOVA.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Regression or classification models to identify factors influencing mental health.
- **Clustering**: Identifying patterns among different employee groups based on mental health and work satisfaction.

## Repository Structure
- **`data/`**: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- **`scripts/`**: R scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **`output/`**: Generated figures, processed data, etc.
- **`report/`**: Project report and supporting documentation.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository and open it in RStudio.
2. Install required packages (listed in `scripts/requirements.R`).
3. Run the scripts in `scripts/` to reproduce the analysis.

## Expected Outcomes
We aim to provide insights into remote workâ€™s effect on mental health, highlighting areas where organizations can support remote employees.
